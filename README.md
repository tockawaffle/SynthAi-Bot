<h3 align="center"> ü§ñ Start using me! üñ•Ô∏è </h3>

There are two avaiable options for you to start using me:

**1:** You can either invite me to your Discord Server by using [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1096096564264579133&scope=bot&permissions=536840858736) link.

(Need any help or support? Join this Discord Server: [Tocka's Nest](https://discord.gg/PtnZGGt8DD) )

**2:** Create your own instance of this bot:

First, you'll need to replace ".env.template" to ".env", and fill the following variables:

```
#This is your Discord Bot Token, you can get one by going to the developer's page and creating a bot.
DISCORD_TOKEN=

#This is a TopGG Token, you might not want to use it, you can remove all files that invoke this one: src/events/topgg, src/bot.ts @ line 9
TOPGG_TOKEN=

#You'll need a MongoDb instance, you can either use a local or hosted instance.
MONGO_URI=

#For development, use .ts, for production, use .js
FILE_EXTENSION=

#You OpenAI API Key
GPT_KEY=

#The proxy API that you'll use to get access to GPT with internet.
GPTE_API= <optional>

#The bard cookie
BARD_COOKIE=

#The bard proxy port, host, username and password (read below)
BARD_PROXY_PORT=
BARD_PROXY_HOST=
BARD_PROXY_USERNAME=
BARD_PROXY_PASSWORD=

```

! MOST of those variables are optional, you MIGHT need every single one of them.
! "GPTE_API" is optional, if none is given, it'll use the built-in module using DuckDuckGo (Might output some weird stuff tho)
! You can get a proxy by using [this](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9457693) link ( referer link ) to create an account on Vultr, and then create a proxy instance. Tutorial [here](https://www.vultr.com/docs/install-squid-proxy-on-ubuntu/). If you don't want to use a proxy, you should remove the proxy settings from the code. (src/configs/ais/chatBased/bard/sing.ts @ line 9-19)
If you wish to create a proxy, but don't want to do the heavy lifting, I might be able set it up for you for a small fee of 5 USD.

If you're using your own proxy (Mainly the squid proxy) and find yourself getting an error thrown while trying to use bard, please refer to [this](https://github.com/PawanOsman/GoogleBard/issues/10) issue.

Install NodeJs >= v18.0.0 and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

And you're done! You can now use your own instance of Synth Bot!

<h4>Obs:</h4> 
This bot only works with NodeJs >= v18.0.0

<h3 align="center"> <a id="faq">FAQ üîç</a> </h3>

Q: How does the AI generate the content?

A: This bot leverages an advanced AI model to create its content. The AI model, which is powered by OpenAI's GPT technology, has been trained on a wide range of data sources. These include books, websites, and other forms of written text. As a result, it has learned to understand and generate human-like text.

When the AI generates content, it doesn't simply copy and paste from its training data. Instead, it uses what it has learned to generate new, original content. This means it's creating sentences, paragraphs, and entire documents based on the patterns and structures it has observed in the training data, not copying specific passages.

To ensure the content aligns with specific needs, I guide the AI with prompts and parameters. This can range from specifying the format of the content (like a README file), to providing a particular style or tone. It's a collaborative process that combines AI capabilities with human guidance to produce the final output.

Q: What exactly was generated by AI on this bot?

A: In the development of this bot, AI played an integral role. It produced most of the content, from the README that you're reading right now to the image you see associated with the bot. While I did handle some formatting tasks, AI was extensively used in crafting the bot's code and many other components. In essence, you could say AI was a co-creator of this bot.

Q: Is this bot free to use?

A: Absolutely! Most of the time, the bot is free to use, as you can receive additional tokens for each [vote](https://top.gg/bot/1096096564264579133) on the bot. That said, if you wish to extend your support, you can monetarily contribute to the project. This will not only provide you with more tokens but also offer you the privilege to beta test new features. If you're interested, you can support me through this [link](https://linktr.ee/nixyan_).

Q: How can I acquire more tokens?

A: There are two primary ways you can earn more tokens. The first is by voting for the bot [here](https://top.gg/bot/1096096564264579133), and the second is by providing monetary support [here](https://linktr.ee/nixyan_).

Q: How can I access the beta features?

A: To gain exclusive access to the bot's beta features, all you have to do is support the project monetarily. You can do this through this [link](https://linktr.ee/nixyan_).

Q: How can I access the source code?

A: If you're interested in looking under the hood, you can access the bot's source code by clicking [here](https://github.com/tockawaffle/SynthAi-Bot).

Q: Can I clone this repository and use it as my own?

A: Yes, you are free to clone this repository and use it as a starting point for your own projects. Please remember to change the bot's name, image, and description to make it unique to your project. You'll also need to host it yourself. According to the license agreement, you must credit me for the original creation.

Q: Can I use the images that this bot generates?

A: Yes, the images generated by this bot are open for you to use as you wish, as per OpenAI's license. Please note that I cannot be held accountable for how you choose to use them.

Q: Can I use the code that this bot generates?

A: Absolutely! The code produced by this bot falls under OpenAI's license, meaning you're free to use it as you see fit. However, I must stress that I hold no responsibility for any actions you take with it.

Q: Will this bot ever require payment?

A: The future of the bot's financial model is somewhat uncertain. Currently, I'm bearing all the costs for its operation out of my own pocket. If expenses rise too high, it may become necessary to require payment for the bot or discontinue its services. However, I'm committed to doing my best to prevent that from happening. If you wish to help me maintain the bot as a free service, you can support the project financially [here](https://linktr.ee/nixyan_). This will not only help me cover the costs of running the bot but also allow me to continue developing new features.
As of 18/05/2023 (DD/MM/YYYY) the current monthly costs are:
Models: USD 15.00 ~ (BRL 75.00 ~)
Hosting: USD 5.00 ~ (BRL 25.00 ~)
Proxies: USD 5.00 ~ (BRL 25.00 ~)
Total: USD 25.00 ~ (BRL 125.00 ~)
Even though the costs are low, where I live (Brazil) the minimum wage is BRL 1.320 ~ (USD 265 ~), so USD 25 is quite a lot for me. If you wish to help me maintain the bot as a free service, you can support the project financially [here](https://linktr.ee/nixyan_). This will not only help me cover the costs of running the bot but also allow me to continue developing new features.

Q: Can I use this bot for commercial purposes?

A: Yes, you are free to use the bot for commercial purposes. However, it's imperative that you read the license agreement in its entirety before proceeding.

Q: Is the bot available in other languages?

A: Yes and no. You can talk to the AI model in whichever language you want to, it'll answer you back in that language (Unless it doesn't have the knowledge on it). However, the bot's interface is only available in English.

Q: Can the bot be integrated into my own application or service?

A: This bot doesn't have an API. However, you can use the bot's source code to create your own version of it. Please note that you must credit me for the original creation as per the license agreement.

Q: What kind of data does the bot collect and how is it used?

A: For users: Only the user id, the rest of the information on the database is created by the bot itself. For guilds: Guild ids, channel ids, channel names and guild names. This information is used to provide the bot's services and is not shared with any third parties.

Q: Is there a limit to how much I can use this bot?

A: Yes.
For Chatbased models you have 15 tokens per month, which can be increased +5 tokens per vote on the bot.
For image generation, it depends on the image size: 1024 = 5 tokens, 512 = 10 tokens, 256 = 15 tokens. These can be increased per vote on the bot.

Q: How often is the bot updated or maintained?

A: While I do my best to keep the bot updated, with new features and bug fixes, I can't guarantee that it will always be up to date since I'm the only developer working on it and my time is limited. However, I do my best to keep it running smoothly and fix any issues that arise as quickly as possible.
