There are two avaiable options for you to start using me:

**1:** You can either invite me to your Discord Server by using [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1096096564264579133&scope=bot&permissions=536840858736) link.

(Need any help or support? Join this Discord Server: [Tocka's Nest](https://discord.gg/PtnZGGt8DD) )

**2:** Create your own instance of this bot:

First, you'll need to replace ".env.template" to ".env", and fill the following variables:

```
#This is your Discord Bot Token, you can get one by going to the developer's page and creating a bot.
DISCORD_TOKEN=

#This is a TopGG Token, you might not want to use it, you can remove all files that invoke this one: src/events/topgg, src/bot.ts @ line 9
TOPGG_TOKEN=

#You'll need a MongoDb instance, you can either use a local or hosted instance.
MONGO_URI=

#For development, use .ts, for production, use .js
FILE_EXTENSION=

#You OpenAI API Key
GPT_KEY=

#The proxy API that you'll use to get access to GPT with internet.
PROXY_API=

```

! NONE of those variables are optional, you WILL need every single one of them.
